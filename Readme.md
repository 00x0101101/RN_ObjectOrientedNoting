## Features

  - Provide some powerUps making noting with the `template/slot system` in RemNote like using OOP languages like Java and C#  where these powerUps can work as some preserved words in these programme languages
### `Partial` in C#
  - The powerUp `~Partial` comes down from the key word `partial` in C#, where this keyword is a modifier to class `C`, making the compiler combines the partial implements of `C` from different files to an integral class
  ```csharp
//other content of Form1 generated by Visual Studio is in other files. 
//application programmers can focus on their part of code.
//when being compiled all the "partial class" with the same name 
//will be converged to one integral class.
public partial class Form1 : Form
{
    public Form1()
     {
         InitializeComponent();
     }
}
 ```

When a Rem (like `New content added to     [[Class 1]]  and  [[Class 2]] ` below)  has been tagged with `~Partial`,  slots of **A**  ( like   `New content added to     [[Class 1]]  and  [[Class 2]]   > Method 3`  in the example below) will change any reference to the  Rem **A**'s slots reference (such as `[[Class2 > [[New content added to     [[Class 1]]  and  [[Class 2]]   > Method 3]] ]]`  ) to what the reference Rem **A** pointing to (like `[[  New content added to     [[Class 1]]  and  [[Class 2]]   > [[Method 3]]   ]] ` )

During RemNote's start or the rem tagged with ~partial (`New content added to     [[Class 1]]  and  [[Class 2]] `) being edited, it will add reference pointing to its slot to what the tagged rem has references to

### `Pointer/*` in C++
- the Rem `[[Object1]]` ,which is tagged with `~Pointer`,  will guide other reference to itself (`[[ [[Object1]] ]]` ) to the rem it is  pointing to  ( turn `[[ [[Object1]] ]]` to `[[Object1]]`  )
- This power up can converge reference to other templates' slot to the information source of the rem, assuring no redundant rems left.

### `Instance(of)` in JS
- this powerUp is used to distinguish `class`&`object` or `definition`&`application`, which may be helpful when using RemNote as a math notebook to document the formula you learned and math exercise you did 
- For `instance`, 
  1. "Newton-Leibniz formula" is a `class` 
  2. A question like "a rabbit ran from (0,0) to (1,0) along the trace of *y=sin(Ï€x)*. how long did it run? " is a `object`
  3. the question in 2 is an `instance(of)` the usage of 1.
  4. And the question in 2 can be tagged with this powerUp to note that it is an `exercise log`, not a `formula` needing memorize.
- **You can use this powerUp by just typing `##~Instance`** 
- At present (version 0.2.1) this powerUp does not have any special function. It only works as an identifier facilitate sorting in the backlink panel and a CSS tag to distinguish `class` and `Object`

## How to use
  
- You can use these powerUps just by using them as tags.
- You can use slash command `clear OON tags` to clear all OON tags attached to current focused rem.
