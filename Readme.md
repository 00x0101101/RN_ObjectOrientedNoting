## Features

  - Provide some powerUps making noting with the `template/slot system` in RemNote like using OOP languages like Java and C#  where these powerUps can work as some preserved words in these programme languages
### `Partial` in C#
  - The powerUp `~Partial` comes down from the key word `partial` in C#, where this keyword is a modifier to class `C`, making the compiler combines the partial implements of `C` from different files to an integral class
  ```csharp
//other content of Form1 generated by Visual Studio is in other files. 
//application programmers can focus on their part of code.
//when being compiled all the "partial class" with the same name 
//will be converged to one integral class.
public partial class Form1 : Form
{
    public Form1()
     {
         InitializeComponent();
     }
}
 ```

When a Rem (like `New content added to     [[Class 1]]  and  [[Class 2]] ` below)  has been tagged with `~Partial`,  slots of **A**  ( like   `New content added to     [[Class 1]]  and  [[Class 2]]   > Method 3`  in the example below) will change any reference to the  Rem **A**'s slots reference (such as `[[Class2 > [[New content added to     [[Class 1]]  and  [[Class 2]]   > Method 3]] ]]`  ) to what the reference Rem **A** pointing to (like `[[  New content added to     [[Class 1]]  and  [[Class 2]]   > [[Method 3]]   ]] ` )

During RemNote's start or the rem tagged with ~partial (`New content added to     [[Class 1]]  and  [[Class 2]] `) being edited, it will add reference pointing to its slot to what the tagged rem has references to

### `Pointer/*` in C++
- the Rem `[[Object1]]` ,which is tagged with `~Pointer`,  will guide other reference to itself (`[[ [[Object1]] ]]` ) to the rem it is  pointing to  ( turn `[[ [[Object1]] ]]` to `[[Object1]]`  )
- This power up can converge reference to other templates' slot to the information source of the rem, assuring no redundant rems left.

## How to use
  
- You can use these powerUps just by using them as tags.
- You can use slash command `clear OON tags` to clear all OON tags attached to current focused rem.
